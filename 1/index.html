                    <h2>Part One: Cable News</h2>
                        <p>
                            Think of any cable news anchor, and then think of another. Who are the people that come to mind? <br>
                            What do all those people have in common?<br>
                            They're all wealthy, and in many cases, related to politicians, or business leaders. <br>
                            Not only do these sorts of ties make it more difficult for cable news to criticise politicians, big business, and the wealthy, <br>
                            they serve as incentives for cable news to protect those interests.

                            Do you know who owns that online newspaper that you like to read? <br>
                            How about that podcast you listen to in the morning? 
                            It might surprise you, but many so-called "independent" outlets are actually owned by bigger firms.

                 <h2>ABC news suspends journalist for being a socialist</h2>
                 <div>Journalist David Wright criticised ABC news, and their biased news coverage.
                 He was secretly recorded while this was happening, in this recording, he called himself a socialist. 
                 Unfortunately, by firing Wright, ABC news proved his accusations to be true.
                 Though the video was intended as a criticism of the medias "hostility" towards trump, 
                 it shows their weakness, and inability to propperly criticise the pro-elite actions of the president
                 because those actions fundementally benefit those in power, and that includes those in the media.

                 Reporter Amy Robach claimed to have evidence proving Epstein's involvment in a child exploitation operation
                 that spanned nations, and involved various celebrities, politicians, and business leaders. She also said that 
                 her bosses prevented her from reporting on the story.
                 She admited to knowing everything during a hot mic moment where she didn't know that she was being recorded.<br>

                 <h2> Sean Hannity campaigns for Trump</h2>
                 <div> FOX News might as well be an extension of the Trump Campaign at this point.
                 In most news organizations, reporters are expected to separate personal politics from their job.
                 But FOX is different, many of those working for FOX are extremely partisan.
                 This is dangerous because many people believe that FOX is an objective news outlet. After all, it is the most popular Cable News outlet.
