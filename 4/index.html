            <h2>Jeff Bezos</h2>
            <p>currently owns the Washington Post. This creates an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to their reporting,
            seeing as they are directly controlled by Jeff Bezos.

                <h2>Breitbart</h2>
                <p>
                Breitbart, though it isn't the most reputable source (for obvious reasons),
                plays a role in our current discourse. Founded by Andrew Breitbart, this outlet is known for providing 
                reactionary talking points that are often parroted by more influential people.
                It is funded by Robert Mercer, who gave at least $10 million to the outlet. That's quite interesting, seeing as
                Robert Mercer has a vested financial interest in loosening government restrictions in the banking sector 
                (something that Breitbart supports).
                </p>
                <h2>Infowars</h2>
                <p>
                Often portrayed as the stereotypical unhinged conspiracy theory ridden nuthouse, Alex Jones' Infowars goes above and beyond
                that. 
                </p>

                <p>This might seem like a parody, but it becomes scary when you think about the people that believe this.
                Imagine the type of person that believes this, and just how much dammage they can do to society.

            <section>
            <h2>Tucker Carlson</h2>
            <p> Tucker Carlson is arguably one of the most influential Cable News presenters. 
            Though Carlson likes to portray himself as a man of the people, he is in fact, an elitist.
            His stepmother was a wealthy heiress to the Swanson frozen food empire.
            He is currently worth over $20 million, and has a salary of $6 million a year.
            </p>
            <h2> Laura Inghram</h2>
            <p> Laura Inghram is the host of the Inghram Angle, a popular news show on FOX. She is currently worth over $70 million
            with an annual salary of $15 million.
            </p>
            <h2>Judge Jeanine</h2>

                These people have some of the dumbest takes on the planet, yet they are worth millions.
                
            </p>
            <h1>Local News</h1>
            <p>Though many of the talking heads on local news don't get paid as much as those in the national media, 
            they are often forced to stick to a script due to the fact that they're owned by one company in most cases.</p>
            <h2>Sinclair Broadcast Groupp</h2> 
            <p> is the corporation that currently owns the majority of local news stations</p>
