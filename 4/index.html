            <h2>Jeff Bezos</h2>
            <p>currently owns the Washington Post. This creates an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to their reporting,
            seeing as they are directly controlled by Jeff Bezos.

                <h2>Breitbart</h2>
                <p>
                Breitbart, though it isn't the most reputable source (for obvious reasons),
                plays a role in our current discourse. Founded by Andrew Breitbart, this outlet is known for providing 
                reactionary talking points that are often parroted by more influential people.
                It is funded by Robert Mercer, who gave at least $10 million to the outlet. That's quite interesting, seeing as
                Robert Mercer has a vested financial interest in loosening government restrictions in the banking sector 
                (something that Breitbart supports).
                </p>
                <h2>Infowars</h2>
                <p>
                Often portrayed as the stereotypical unhinged conspiracy theory ridden nuthouse, Alex Jones' Infowars goes above and beyond
                that. 
                </p>

                <p>This might seem like a parody, but it becomes scary when you think about the people that believe this.
                Imagine the type of person that believes this, and just how much dammage they can do to society, now imagine an army of these people.
                That is the true danger of Infowars.

            <h1>Wall St Journal</h1>
            <section>
            <h2> Have you ever heard of Rupert Murdoch?</h2>
            <p> Chances are, you haven't unless you know about investing. Murdoch belongs to a very powerful family, 
            one that is worth about $400 Billion. Rupert Murdoch is the proud owner of News Corp, the people who publish the DOW Jones.
            Despite being one of the least nefarious billionares, there is still a potential conflict of interest when dealing with
            massive amounts of wealth and investment that people like Murdoch have.
